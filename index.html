			<h1>Venice in the Middle Ages</h1>
			According to tradition Venice was founded in 421 AD. At that time a Celtic people called
			the Veneti lived along the coast of what is now Northeast Italy. Since 49 BC they had been
			Roman citizens. However in 453 Attila the Hun invaded Italy. In terror some Veneti fled to
			islands in the lagoon and built village there. They soon formed a loose federation.
			Then in 568 AD a people called the Lombards invaded the mainland and many Veneti
			fled to the islands swelling the population.
			At first Venice was controlled by the Byzantine Empire (the Eastern half of the Roman Empire,
			which survived the fall of Rome). However in 726 the Venetians partly gained their
			independence and elected Orso Ipato as doge (their word for duke).
			In 810 the Franks tried but failed to conquer the Venetians. Meanwhile Venice flourished
			as a trading center and ships sailed to and from its ports. Its population grew steadily.
			In 828 the body of St Mark was smuggled from Egypt to Venice. St Mark then became
			the patron saint of the city.
			In the Middle Ages Venice continued to flourish as a port and trading center.
			Meanwhile in 1199 a fourth crusade was proposed.
			The Venetians agreed to build a fleet of ships to ferry the Crusaders.
			However when the Crusader army assembled they were unable to pay for the ships.
			So the Venetians persuaded them to join an expedition to raid Constantinople.
			Venetians and Crusaders captured the city in 1204 and they looted it.
			Venice was also involved in other wars at that time. The Italian city of
			Genoa was a powerful rival to Venice and during the 13th and 14th centuries
			the Genoese and Venetians fought 5 wars.
			Furthermore in 1348 the Black Death devastated the population of Venice.
			Therefore in 1403 Venice introduced quarantine. Ships arriving from infected
			areas had to stop at an island called Lazaretto and the passengers had to wait
			for 40 days before they were permitted to enter the city.
			In the 15th century Venice faced a new threat - the Turks. In 1453 they
			captured Constantinople and afterwards they advanced into Southeast Europe.
			In 1489 Venice came to rule Cyprus. However in 1571 the Turks conquered the island.
			Furthermore in 1508 several European countries formed the League of Cambrai
			and went to war against Venice. However after 8 years of war the map was largely unchanged.
